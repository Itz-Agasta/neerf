# LockBit-style Ransomware Simulation for NERRF

This document outlines controlled LockBit-style ransomware simulations for NEERF M0 (Research Lock-in) and M1 (Tracker Alpha) milestones. The goal is to define realistic file-level syscalls and encryption behavior within Kubernetes pods to validate the dependency graph and undo planner.

## About LockBit

LockBit is a **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)** platform active since mid-2019, operated by the **GOLD MYSTIC** group. According to a joint statement by various government agencies, LockBit was the world's most prolific ransomware in 2022. It was estimated in early 2023 to be responsible for `44% of all ransomware` incidents globally. In the United States between January 2020 and May 2023, LockBit was used in approximately `1,700 ransomware attacks`, with $91 million paid in ransom to hackers.

It gains initial access to computer systems using purchased access, unpatched vulnerabilities, insider access, and zero-day exploits, in the same way as other malware. LockBit then takes control of the infected system, collects network information, and steals and encrypts data. Demands are then made for the victim to pay a ransom for their data to be decrypted so that it is again available, and for the perpetrators to delete their copy, with the threat of otherwise making the data public.

### Techniques and tactics

LockBit operators frequently gain initial access by exploiting vulnerable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers or compromised credentials purchased from affiliates. Initial access vectors also include phishing emails with malicious attachments or links, brute-forcing weak RDP or VPN passwords, and exploiting vulnerabilities such as `CVE-2018-13379` in Fortinet VPNs.

Once installed, LockBit ransomware is often executed in Microsoft Windows via command-line arguments, scheduled tasks, or PowerShell scripts such as PowerShell Empire. LockBit uses tools such as Mimikatz, GMER, Process Hacker, and registry edits to gather credentials, disable security products, and evade defenses. It enumerates network connections to identify high-value targets such as domain controllers using scanners such as Advanced Port Scanner.

For lateral movement, LockBit spreads through SMB file-sharing connections inside networks, using credentials gathered earlier. Other lateral movement techniques include distributing itself via compromised Group Policy objects, or using tools such as PsExec or Cobalt Strike.

LockBit's ransomware payload encrypts files and network shares using AES and RSA encryption. It encrypts only the first few kilobytes of each file for faster processing, and adds a ".lockbit" extension. LockBit then replaces the desktop wallpaper with a ransom note; it can also print ransom notes to attached printers. The goal is to extort payment of a ransom to reverse system disruption and restore file access.

| _Note_: ND-JSON: One JSON object per line for streaming to RocksDB.

### 6. Takeaway

Both scales validate the scenario’s feasibility for MTTR <60s. The 6× throughput scaling supports NERRF’s design, indicating I/O is not the bottleneck, decision logic (via AI/MCTS in M4) will be key. Next, the `trace.proto` schema will standardize these 88-155 events, and the dataset plan will scale to 100h benign + 1h attack data.
