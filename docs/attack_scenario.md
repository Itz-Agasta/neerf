# LockBit-style Ransomware Simulation for NEERF

This document defines controlled LockBit-style simulations for NEERF M0 and M1 milestones. The goal is to produce realistic file-level syscalls and encryption behavior within Kubernetes pods to validate our dependency graph and undo planner.

## üéØ Benchmark Results (Validated August 2025)

### **M0 Benchmark (Basic Validation)**

- **Scale**: 25 files, ~13MB total
- **MTTR**: < 5 seconds (target: < 60 minutes) ‚ö°
- **Data Loss**: 0 bytes (target: < 128MB) ‚úÖ
- **Trace Events**: 86 syscall events captured
- **Platform**: Minikube with Docker driver

### **M1 Benchmark (Enterprise Scale)**

- **Scale**: 46 files, ~108MB total (114MB actual)
- **MTTR**: < 1 second (target: < 60 minutes) ‚ö°
- **Data Loss**: 0 bytes (target: < 128MB) ‚úÖ
- **Trace Events**: 152 syscall events captured
- **File Types**: Documents, spreadsheets, media, databases
- **Platform**: Minikube enterprise simulation

**Acceptance Criteria**: ‚úÖ ACHIEVED - Both M0 and M1 exceed recovery targets

## ÔøΩ LockBit TTPs (Reference Implementation)

### **Attack Phases (Implemented)**

1. **Initial Access**: `kubectl exec` into simulation pod
2. **Reconnaissance**: Process, network, user, disk enumeration (5 seconds)
3. **Lateral Movement**: Simulated network scanning and credential gathering
4. **Preparation**: File seeding and target identification
5. **Encryption**: Realistic file encryption with rate limiting (~0.9 MB/s)
6. **Persistence**: Ransom note deployment and cleanup

### **File Type Categories (M1 Enterprise)**

- **Documents**: Contracts, reports, presentations (`.docx`, `.pdf`)
- **Spreadsheets**: Financial data, analytics (`.xlsx`, `.csv`)
- **Media**: Marketing assets, videos (`.jpg`, `.mp4`, `.png`)
- **Databases**: Customer data, inventory (`.db`, `.sql`)

### **Syscall Patterns Generated**

- `openat()`: File access and creation
- `write()`: Encryption data streams
- `unlink()`: Original file removal
- `rename()`: Atomic file replacement
- `fsync()`: Data persistence validation

LockBit is a **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)** platform active since mid-2019, operated by the **GOLD MYSTIC** group. According to a joint statement by various government agencies, LockBit was the world's most prolific ransomware in 2022. It was estimated in early 2023 to be responsible for `44% of all ransomware` incidents globally. In the United States between January 2020 and May 2023, LockBit was used in approximately `1,700 ransomware attacks`, with $91 million paid in ransom to hackers.

It gains initial access to computer systems using purchased access, unpatched vulnerabilities, insider access, and zero-day exploits, in the same way as other malware. LockBit then takes control of the infected system, collects network information, and steals and encrypts data. Demands are then made for the victim to pay a ransom for their data to be decrypted so that it is again available, and for the perpetrators to delete their copy, with the threat of otherwise making the data public.

### Techniques and tactics

LockBit operators frequently gain initial access by exploiting vulnerable Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) servers or compromised credentials purchased from affiliates. Initial access vectors also include phishing emails with malicious attachments or links, brute-forcing weak RDP or VPN passwords, and exploiting vulnerabilities such as `CVE-2018-13379` in Fortinet VPNs.

Once installed, LockBit ransomware is often executed in Microsoft Windows via command-line arguments, scheduled tasks, or PowerShell scripts such as PowerShell Empire. LockBit uses tools such as Mimikatz, GMER, Process Hacker, and registry edits to gather credentials, disable security products, and evade defenses. It enumerates network connections to identify high-value targets such as domain controllers using scanners such as Advanced Port Scanner.

For lateral movement, LockBit spreads through SMB file-sharing connections inside networks, using credentials gathered earlier. Other lateral movement techniques include distributing itself via compromised Group Policy objects, or using tools such as PsExec or Cobalt Strike.

LockBit's ransomware payload encrypts files and network shares using AES and RSA encryption. It encrypts only the first few kilobytes of each file for faster processing, and adds a ".lockbit" extension. LockBit then replaces the desktop wallpaper with a ransom note; it can also print ransom notes to attached printers. The goal is to extort payment of a ransom to reverse system disruption and restore file access.

### **Usage for NEERF Development**

1. **eBPF Tracker Training**: Use trace patterns to train syscall detection models
2. **GNN Node Features**: File paths, sizes, timestamps become graph node attributes
3. **LSTM Sequence Learning**: Attack phase transitions for temporal modeling
4. **MCTS Planning**: Ground truth provides optimal recovery paths
5. **Firecracker Validation**: Test recovery in isolated sandbox environments

### **Next Steps for M1 Milestone**

- [ ] Integrate eBPF tracker with M1 trace patterns
- [ ] Train GNN on 152-event enterprise dataset
- [ ] Implement LSTM temporal sequence detection
- [ ] Validate MCTS rollback planning
- [ ] Deploy Firecracker sandbox recovery testing
